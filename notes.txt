- Once there is a non-mod key in any of the events, sequence is over.
  - Once non-mod key is detected anywhere, gather all previously seen mod keys, and that is final seq.

- Test cases:
  - alt + U
  - ctrl+cmd+K


When released.length == pressed.length (or num keyups == num keydowns?), and
pressed.length > 1 and
at least one "normal key (non-unicode)" and one "modifier" (these 2 lines are optional)
then
keyCombo is union(mod keys from released and pressed) + "normal key (wherever it is)"

What to do if jwerty doesn't recognize it? (should recognize anything that is correct onKeyDown and outside of a textbox)
